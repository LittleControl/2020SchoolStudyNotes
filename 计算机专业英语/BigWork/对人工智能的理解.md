# 对人工智能的理解

在我的理解而言,我相信以后人工智能定会越来越发达,进而替代人类的一些东西.这是不可避免,也没有必要惶恐的东西.因为我相信,人类的职业并不会减少,一些老的职业被代替,那么一些新的职业就会出现.关于人工智能最终控制人类的理论,我认为时很荒谬的.但是不可否认的时,可能会出现对人类很危险的机器人,这也是不可避免的.就像这世界也不是只有好人一般,坏人的出现也是难免的.

In my understanding, I believe that artificial intelligence will become more and more developed in the future, and then replace some of human things. This is inevitable and there is no need for fear. Because I believe that human occupations will not decrease, Some old occupations are replaced, then some new occupations will appear. I think the theory of artificial intelligence finally controlling humans is ridiculous. But when it is undeniable, robots that are dangerous to humans may appear, which is also Inevitable. Just like the world is not just about good people, the appearance of bad people is inevitable.
